# PHo

PHo is short for "Persistent Homology." I named the project this because I also enjoy the soup "pho."

The purpose of this repository is to give various hands-on introductions to persistent homology. Currently, the only project implemented is "LetterClassifier." This project reads in an image file (as, say, a .png), and classifies it as one of the 26 English letters (capitalized). Or at least it tries to do this. More details will come later...
